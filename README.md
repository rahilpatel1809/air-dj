# Air DJ – Gesture Operated DJ Controller

*Air DJ* is a computer vision–based DJ controller that lets you mix tracks and control effects using just your hands.

⚠️ Note: This project is a work in progress (WIP). It works, but the gesture tracking and stability aren’t yet up to the level I want.

## Current Features:
- Load and play two tracks on virtual decks
- Hand gestures for basic controls like play/pause, volume, tempo, fade-ins/outs

## Tech Stack:
- Python
- OpenCV + MediaPipe: gesture tracking
- sounddevice: audio playback & effects

## Issues:
- Computer vision tracking is glitchy and very inconsistent
- Performance may vary across lighting conditions and webcams

## Improvement Scopes:
- Improve gesture detection accuracy and stability
- Add more DJ effects (pitch shift, filters, delays)
- Optimise audio latency for smoother mixing
- Add a GUI for a DJ software interface like Rekordbox
